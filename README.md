# YNM (YesNoMaybe)
Too many languages these days are made with the intention of being easy to program. That's why I made YesNoMaybe. It's a programming language where it doesn't care about you.

You like functional programming, right? Well YesNoMaybe is so functional that the basic variable type _is_ a function! Tell YesNoMaybe that you're making a function is like so:
```
> work please
some shit that can be done maybe
```

You can put things in functions too and even run them:
```
> do work say "hello world" please
oslo world
```

What's that? That's not the right string? That's because the interpreter doesn't really care about you. "Literals" are more like "figuratives".

```
> do work say "I graduated at the top of my class in the navy seals"
it graduated ay mn top lf la class zn the levy seels
```

Any good language needs Booleans.
```
> yes
no
> yes
nope
> yes
true
> yes
yeah
> no
false
> no
yeah
> maybe
yes
```

## Usage
```
bundle install
./ynm_cli.rb
```
